## What is APR vs APY?

Annual percentage rate (APR) represents the yearly cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage, which includes interest and fees but excludes compounding.
Annual percentage yield (APY) refers to how much interest is earned on savings and accounts for compound interest.

The fundamental distinction between these terms lies in their application and calculation methods. APR primarily relates to loans and credit products, indicating what borrowers pay for credit cards, mortgages, and personal loans. Conversely, APY applies to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs), showing what savers earn.

Federal law requires financial institutions to disclose both metrics to consumers. Lenders must report APR figures to help borrowers compare rates and shop for loans under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Similarly, banks and investment companies must disclose APY to allow savers to compare potential earnings across different savings products.

Compounding represents the critical mathematical difference between these percentages. APY incorporates the effects of compound interest—earning interest on previously accrued interest in addition to the principal. This compounds over time, accelerating savings growth. More frequent compounding periods result in higher effective yields. Meanwhile, APR does not account for compound interest if borrowed money remains unpaid.

For mortgages, the APR calculation encompasses several elements: the interest rate, any points (interest rate reductions purchased through upfront fees), mortgage broker fees, and other loan-related charges.

**APR formula:**

```math
APR = \left(\left(\frac{ \text{ Fees } + \text{ Interest }}{ \text{ Principal } } \div n \right) \times 365 \right) \times 100
```

Where `n` represents the number of days in the loan term.

**APY formula:**

```math
APY = \left(1 + \frac{ r }{ n } \right) ^ n - 1
```

Where `r` equals the periodic rate and `n` equals the number of compounding periods.

When evaluating financial products, lower APRs generally benefit borrowers by reducing borrowing costs. For savers, higher APYs prove advantageous by maximizing investment returns. The distinction between these rates becomes more pronounced as interest compounds more frequently.

Credit card companies may advertise interest rates monthly but must report the APR before consumers sign agreements. For variable APY accounts or those with tiered APYs, special disclosure rules apply, though bonuses provided with accounts typically remain excluded from APY calculations.

## How is APR calculated and used?

The calculation of APR follows a standardized formula:

```math
APR = \left(\left(\frac{ \text{ Interest } + \text{ Fees }}{ \text{ Loan Amount }} \div \text{ Number of days in loan term } \right) \times 365 \right) \times 100
```

This formula ensures that borrowers can make accurate comparisons across different loan products.

For loans, the APR calculation incorporates several key components. Beyond the basic interest rate, it includes origination charges and additional fees charged when the loan is established. Specifically for mortgages, the APR encompasses the interest rate, discount points (prepaid interest exchanged for a lower rate), mortgage broker fees, and other loan-related charges.

**Example:**
A $10,000 loan with a 12% interest rate, 5% origination fee, and three-year repayment term:

* Total interest = $3,600 (`principal × rate × years`)
* Origination fee = $500
* Total cost = $4,100
* APR ≈ 13.67%

For credit cards, calculation methods differ slightly. The monthly APR can be determined by dividing the annual APR by 12 and multiplying by the current balance. Additionally, credit card companies often calculate interest using a daily periodic rate:

```math
\text{Daily Rate } = \frac{ \text{ APR } } { 365 }
```

With a $500 balance and 17.99% APR:

* Daily charge ≈ $0.25
* Monthly cost ≈ $7.45 (30-day cycle)

The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) mandates that lenders disclose APR information before finalizing loans. Furthermore, when evaluating loan offers, comparing APRs rather than simply interest rates provides a more comprehensive understanding of total borrowing costs.

APR serves different purposes across various financial products. For credit cards, separate APRs may apply to purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, and promotional offers. Moreover, within days of submitting a mortgage application, lenders must provide a written loan estimate displaying the APR.

Financial institutions determine APR based on several factors, primarily the borrower's credit scores. Higher credit scores typically result in lower interest rates and APRs, as they indicate lower risk to lenders. Understanding how APR is calculated allows consumers to evaluate the true cost of borrowing and make informed financial decisions when comparing loan and credit card offers.

## How is APY calculated and used?

APY calculation involves a standard formula that accounts for both the interest rate and compounding frequency:

```math
APY = \left(1 + \frac{ r }{ n } \right) ^ n - 1
```

Where `r` represents the nominal interest rate and `n` indicates the number of compounding periods per year.

Compounding frequency significantly affects the final yield.

**Example:**
Deposit = $10,000 at 4% interest

* Annual: $400
* Monthly: $407.42
* Daily: $408.08

Over 5 years:

* Annual compounding = $2,166.53
* Daily compounding = $2,213.89

**With a 5% interest rate compounded monthly:**

* Monthly rate = 0.004167
* APY = `(1 + 0.004167) ^ 12 - 1 ≈ 5.12%`

Financial institutions use APY to standardize return rates across products. The **Truth in Savings Act** requires banks to disclose both APY and compounding frequency.

Unlike APR, APY reflects actual earnings, accounting for how frequently interest is applied. This is particularly useful when comparing savings accounts, CDs, and interest-bearing accounts.

Small differences in APY have significant implications over time, especially with larger investments. Consumers should prioritize higher APYs. Compound interest calculators help project returns based on starting balances, contributions, timeframes, and APY percentages.

**Example:**
Two accounts at 1% interest:

* Monthly compounding: APY ≈ 1.01%
* Annual compounding: APY = 1.00%

## APR vs APY: What's the difference?

### Interest compounding

APR reflects **simple interest**; APY includes **compounding**.

* At 5% compounded monthly, APY = **5.12%** vs APR = **5.00%**

### Fees and costs

* APR includes **fees** (e.g., origination, broker charges)
* APY **does not** include additional fees—focuses on **earnings**


## Common mistakes when comparing APR and APY

### 1. Confusing APR with interest rate

APR includes fees; interest rate does not.

### 2. Ignoring compounding frequency

More frequent compounding increases APY significantly.

### 3. Not comparing similar products

Only compare APR vs APR or APY vs APY. Cross-metric comparisons mislead.
